# pandas-challenge
This was quite the Pandas challenge for me. The counts were a little easier, but definitely had trouble sorting and adding more difficult calculations in my data frames. Not entirely sure what I need to write here since my first time, but using this to make some notes. I went as far with the homework as my time allowed unfortunately. I do believe I was able to complete more than expected actually. I need to continue building upon panda skills since Python is one major focus for me taking the course to better understand how data scientists I work with approach a project.
